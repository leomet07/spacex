				SpaceX has raised over $1.9 billion in new funding this month,
				representing its largest single fundraising round to date,
				according to a report from SpaceNews. A regulatory filing on
				Tuesday (Aug. 18) showed that 75 investors made equity
				investments in Elon Musk's launch company. SpaceX is also
				selling an additional $165 million in common stock, which would
				put the final amount of new funding at $2.07 billion, SpaceNews
				reported. The California-based company raised more than $346
				million in May after increasing the ceiling to $350 million, up
				from $250 million in February, according to the company's
				earlier filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
				(SEC). "None of those SEC disclosures were filed at the end of
				SpaceX's fundraising rounds. If both rounds are funded to
				completion, then SpaceX will have raised $2.41 billion," Space
				News reported.

				one such mission, according to Space News.
