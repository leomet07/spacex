			<h3>
				The SpaceX Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by
				SpaceX for use on its Falcon 1, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch
				vehicles. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket
				propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine
				was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The injector
				at the heart of Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used
				in the Apollo Lunar Module landing engine (LMDE). Propellants
				are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump. The
				turbopump also provides high-pressure fluid for the hydraulic
				actuators, which then recycles into the low-pressure inlet. This
				eliminates the need for a separate hydraulic drive system and
				means that thrust vectoring control failure by running out of
				hydraulic fluid is not possible.

			<h3>
				As of August 2011, SpaceX was producing Merlin engines at the
				rate of eight per month, planning eventually to raise production
				to about 33 engines per month (or 400 per year). By September
				2013, SpaceX total manufacturing space had increased to nearly
				93,000 square meters (1,000,000 sq ft) and the factory had been
				configured to achieve a maximum production rate of up to 40
				rocket cores per year, enough to use the 400 annual engines
				envisioned by the earlier engine plan. By October 2014, SpaceX
				announced it had manufactured the 100th Merlin 1D engine and
				that engines were now being produced at a rate of 4 per week,
				soon to be increased to 5. By June 2015, SpaceX was producing
				Merlin engines at the rate of four Merlin 1D engines per week,
				with a total production capacity in the factory of a maximum of
				five per week. In February 2016, SpaceX indicated that the
				company will need to build hundreds of engines a year in order
				to support a Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy build rate of 30 rocket cores
				per year by the end of 2016.
