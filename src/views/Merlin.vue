			<h3>
				The SpaceX Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by
				SpaceX for use on its Falcon 1, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch
				vehicles. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket
				propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine
				was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The injector
				at the heart of Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used
				in the Apollo Lunar Module landing engine (LMDE). Propellants
				are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump. The
				turbopump also provides high-pressure fluid for the hydraulic
				actuators, which then recycles into the low-pressure inlet. This
				eliminates the need for a separate hydraulic drive system and
				means that thrust vectoring control failure by running out of
				hydraulic fluid is not possible.
